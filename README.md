# Kernel_Assisted_Learning
For optimal personalized dose finding

This repository contains the R code for Kernel Assisted Learning (KAL) and two comparision methods, discretized Q-learning and O-learning.
Each method comes with three files.  
-functions.R contains the functions need to be used for simulation and real data application. 
-simulation.R contains the code for running simulations. 
-realdata.R contains the code for applying the method to realdata. 

The dataset is a wafarin dosing dataset coming from https://www.pharmgkb.org/downloads/   
 iwpc_data_7_3_09_revised.csv contains the original realdata. 
 data-preprocess.R contains the code for data preprocessing. 
 data-processed.csv contains the data after processing.
